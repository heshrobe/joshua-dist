	    #+LUCID "USER"
	    #+CLOE "CLOE")
;;;
;;; Package definitions for Joshua. This stuff is not in the defsystem
;;; file so that it's patchable.  E.g., we might want to export a new
;;; symbol in a patch.  (Also due to make-system brain-death in always loading
;;; the latest version of the defsystem file.)
;;;
;;; The symbols fall into 3 classes:
;;;
;;; * Undocumented internal symbols.
;;;   Users shouldn't ever have to refer to these.
;;;   If they do, either they're doing something wrong or  we forgot to export something.
;;;   These are internal symbols of JI.

;;; * Potentially-dangerous low-level things:
;;;   We'd rather users not mess with these, but it's ok if they know what they're doing.
;;;   These are external symbols exported from JI.

;;; * Documented user-available things in Joshua.
;;;   These are in the JOSHUA package.

;;; Here's how that is implemented.  There are 3 packages: Joshua-Internals, Joshua,
;;; and Joshua-User.  Implementation is done in Joshua-Internals which uses Joshua.
;;; So symbols in category 3 are simply defined in Joshua and put into the export-list of Joshua.
;;; User programs should be written in packages which use Joshua and either CL or SCL.
;;; Joshua-User is an example of such a package.
;;; Such packages inherit all the category 3 symbols, making them accessible without prefix.
;;; Category 2 symbols are put in the export list of JI.  This makes them accessible as JI:foobar.

;;; Implementors note:  If you want to "promote" a symbol from category 1 (protected internals)
;;; to category 2 (an accessible internal).
;;; then you add it to the :EXPORT list
;;; of JI (but don't patch the defpackage).
;;; Then put (export '(JI::foo)) in the patch.  Note that you must not do this in your
;;; running  world before you make the patch, or the patch's bin file
;;; will get ji:foo as opposed to ji::foo  dumped to it.  You could
;;; unexport before making the patch, I suppose. Or make the patch say
;;; (export (list (intern "FOO" 'ji))).

;;;   If you want to promote it to category 2 (user accessible) add it to the :EXPORT
;;;   list of JOSHUA (but don't patch the defpackage).  Then add
;;;   (globalize 'ji::foo "JOSHUA") to the patch.  Be sure the first arg
;;;   to globalize is the symbol, not a string, so eq-ness will be
;;;   preserved.  Note that you must not do this in your running world
;;;   before you make the patch, or the patch's bin file will get
;;;   joshua:foo as opposed to ji::foo dumped to it.
;;;   (globalize (intern "FOO" 'ji) "JOSHUA") might be safer.
