;; This is tricky.
;;
;; We're doing a backward-chaining kind of inference  but we
;; take advantage of the fact that there's an underlying
;; forward-chaining mechanism  for equalities.
;;
;; If there is no value in this slot, we spread out an activation
;; ring to everyone it's connected to, ASK'ing each of those
;; slots to get the value.  We allow rules and questions to be
;; invoked on them.
;;
;; Since we cache deduced values, if one of the slots chained to
;; deduces a value, he'll TELL that that's his
;; value, and then the value will propagate back to us by the
;; forward-chaining slot-with-equalities mechanisms.
;;
;; We pass Ignore in as the continuation of ASK because this is
;; just a before method that causes the other slots to do some work
;; The first thing the main method does is to check for values
;; explicitly in the slot.  As just argued, the values will be
;; there.  So he'll call the continuation on it and therefore we
;; don't need to notice the other slots succeeding.
;;
;; Finally notice that this is a symmetric backward chaining

;;; that fill in default values for some property of the wing that the rule talks about.
;;; Were we to do things the obvious way, then the Tell's corresponding to those initiazations
;;; would happen before the wing object was hooked up to the wing object in the plane prototype
;;; (it would be hooked up to the prototype for wings in general) which is where the rule trigger
;;; is.  This could be fixed by checking for predications that match the rule trigger as it's inserted
;;; and there's even code below that can do that in trigger-rules-of-linked-up-slot which could be called
;;; from add-object (which is where this happens).  However, this guarantees that rules won't get run
;;; until all the structure is built.

;;; Consider two variant slot-value-patters (e.g. [value-of (?x host-os) ?y] [value-of (?a host-os) ?b]
;;; but the object type of ?x isn't the object-type of ?a
;;; In that case, the triggers ought not to be merged
;;; But the continuation that's passed to tell whether things are the same or not, doesn't
;;; check for that.  The fix is to make sure that not only do we agree on truth-value and variant of the pattern
;;; but that the object-type of the two are also the same.
;;; To see that this is right, consider that the [value-of (?foo )...] predication in effect has another argument, the
;;; type of ?foo which is provided by the [object-type-of ?foo ] predication elsewhere in the pattern.
;;; So the variant check for merging needs to include a check for identical types.
