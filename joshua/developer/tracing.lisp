;;; The Joshua tracing substrate

;;; This file contains:
;;;
;;; The defclass and methods for the following classes
;;;
;;; 1.) Joshua-debbugger - keeps track of all of the global state of Joshua
;;; tracing. It makes sure that the right events are enabled and
;;; encapsulated. It provides the top level interface for enabling and
;;; disabling tracing. It knows how to do joshua encapsulations.

;;; 2.) tracing-event - each event at which we might want to trap out
;;; for tracing is defined as one of these. In addition there is a macro
;;; automatically defined for each event that you can insert into your
;;; code. It will make sure that the appropriate tracer is called when
;;; tracing for that event is enabled.
;;;
;;; 3.) Joshua-encapsulations - most events have associated
;;; encapsulations so the system can do the tracing related bookkeeping
;;; only when tracing is on. Encapsulations are cached and managed by
;;; the tracing-events which depend on them. When you enable the
;;; tracing of an event, it will encapsulate the appropriate functions.
;;; See also the file encapsulations.lisp where a number of the
;;; encapsulations are defined.
;;;
;;; 4.) tracers - Each "Type of Tracing" (Forward Rule Tracing, Backward
;;; Rule Tracing...) uses tracer as a component class. A tracer is
;;; defined to have a collection of associated tracing events and
;;; controls the interface to those events. The trace-it method of each
;;; tracer does the actual output for those events. They also keep track
;;; of any filtering the user wants to do on the traced events. For
;;; example the Forward Rule Tracer keeps a list of traced forward rule
;;; triggers.
;;;
;;; 4) forward-rule-tracer, backward-rule-tracer, predication-tracer,
;;; and tms-tracer - These are the classes of the four types of tracers.
;;;
;;; It also contains all of the definitions that create the instances of
;;; the event and the tracers and register them with joshua-debugger.
;;; See define-tracing-event and define-tracer

;;; This file uses an arglist declaration; this is not defined by common lisp.
;;; this provides it:

#| Comments by hes on porting strategy:

The original version assumed access to very low level mechanisms that allowed advising almost anything.
In particular, it assumed that you can advise a specific method.  I believe that certain implementations
make this hard or require access to mechanisms that the prudent implementor would avoid.  In Genera, for example,
I'm not sure that you can, in fact, trace method, as opposed to the generic function.

Looking through the actual uses, I believe that the only uses of method tracing are for ltms specific implementations
of the basic tms protocol.   While it's possible that we might someday add a variety of other tms styles, we haven't
done it yet (after a number of years).  Therefore, although it's less elegant by far (in fact a kludge) we're just
going to encapsulate the generic function and typecase the first argument (the origin of all this was flavors after all
where only the first argument was used for dispatch.

If this approach fails we can alway think of other options.

Every implementation has an Advise capability (check allegro) but they vary.
arglist convention of MCL for the moment.

The MCL arglist is: fspec the-advise &key when name define-if-not
where name is a unique name for this piece of advise.

Allegro uses the following format: fspec where name position &rest forms
position is for ordering separate pieces of advise.

Allegro also has a facility called fwrapper which is more general, but not available in MCL.
