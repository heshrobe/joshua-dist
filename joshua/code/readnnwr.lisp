;;;
;;; Source code representations of Joshua logic variables and predications.
;;;

;;;
;;; Design notes:
;;;
;;; In the implementation until recently, there was a special variable called *known-lvs* which is
;;; supposed to always be bound to the already seen logic-variables that lexically scope where we
;;; are in execution or compilation.  This was kept current using Compiler-let to rebind *known-lvs*
;;; as new logic-variables were introduced (by ask or rule matching for example).
;;; This approach works for compiled code but not for interpreted.
;;; This isn't surprising given the description above that we are
;;; using dynamic binding of *known-lvs* to keep track of lexical context.

;;; The failure case occurs in interpreted code.  Consider Rule-1
;;; which has a pattern (call it pattern-1) in the If-part which
;;; triggers Rule-2 to satisfy this goal.  Rule-2 succeeds and calls
;;; it's continuation, which is code that tries to satisfy the next
;;; pattern (call it pattern-2).  Pattern-2 wants to execute in an environment that corresponds to its
;;; lexical scope.  But *Known-lvs* is really part of this environment and it was last bound by Rule-2
;;; with stuff having nothing to do with pattern-2's scope in Rule-1.

;;; Oddly enough, we haven't seen this bug for all of the 15 or so
;;; years of this code's life, because we always run compiled.
;;; Because the compiler walks the code for a rule all at once, dynamic scope winds up
;;; being the same as lexical scope.  The variable *known-lvs* needs to be special
;;; because it has to have a value in the global environment so that
;;; top level forms can compare their set of logical-variables to that of
;;; the enclosing scope.  And it goes downhill from there.
;;;
;;; The fix is to pass info along as part of Lisp's environment
;;; (either compiler or interpreter environment) and to extend the
;;; environment with updated bindings for Known-lvs (no longer a
;;; special variable).  Alas Cltl-2 never adopted the environment
;;; proposal, although each implementation has some variant of it.

;;; However, you don't really need the equivalent of
;;; Augment-Environment, because there's a portable way to do an
;;; equivalent using macrolet and macroexpand and carefully managing
;;; the &environment argument's to these.  Macrolet creates a binding
;;; of a new macro, called known-lvs, which macroexpands to NIL in the
;;; global environment and which macroexpands to the set of lexically
;;; seen logic-variables in each nested environment.
;;; So you just have to be careful to pass along the environment.
;;;  This also eliminates the use of the deprecated compiler-let.

;;; Where this is used:
;;; 1) Known-lvs is used in reformulating the syntax for a
;;; predication (called a predication maker) so that it appropriately
;;; backquotes and commifies the logic-variables inside.  In
;;; particular, all syntax for references to logic-variables
;;; (logic-variable-maker) must be commified.  Tell is a special case
;;; of this.
;;;
;;; 2) Ask binds logic-variables and the continuation needs to know
;;; which logic-variables are already bound, so that if there's
;;; another ask inside it doesn't bind more.
;;;
;;; 3) Backward chaining rules: we compile them by finding all the
;;; logic-variables in both the if-part and then-part and then binding
;;; them at the top-level.  This needs to be communicated to the code
;;; that generates the matcher and body.  Also, in compiling the body,
;;; uses the code-walker to see if there's any calls to succeed in the body.
;;; The code walker needs to be invoked with the right environment so
;;; that when it macroexpands logic-variables they don't complain
;;; about being out of scope.  Actually, nothing cares whether they
;;; are or not, but the code walker does macroexpand them at the moment.
;;; At the moment, I use augment-environment in this case only, but either
;;; a) I can stop the code walker from expanding the
;;; logic-variable-maker macros (which would be appropriate) or
;;; b) I can use the binding trick in the code walker (an evaluation
;;; of a doubly nested macrolet to get the right environment set up).
;;;
;;; 4) Forward chaining rules: The pattern matchers for the If-part
;;; are all compiled independently and at top-level, since they become
;;; match-nodes of the rete network.  The then-part needs to be passed
;;; the right environment, but that works trivially using macrolet.

;;; So in summary, the macrolet trick should work for both compiled and
;;; interpreted code and should handle all the cases we need.  There
;;; should be no references to *known-lvs* left in the code.
